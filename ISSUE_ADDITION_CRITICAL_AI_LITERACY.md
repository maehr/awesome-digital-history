**Rationale for the addition**

This resource should be added to the Learning section of the awesome-digital-history list because it provides essential guidance for historians who are increasingly working with AI-powered tools and methods. As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in digital history workflows, this resource fills a critical gap by helping historians:

1. **Understand AI capabilities and limitations**: The guide helps historians develop a realistic understanding of what AI can and cannot do in historical research contexts.

2. **Apply critical methodology**: It encourages historians to maintain their critical analytical skills when working with AI tools, ensuring that AI is used as a complement to, not a replacement for, traditional historical methods.

3. **Address ethical considerations**: As AI raises important questions about bias, representation, and historical interpretation, this resource provides frameworks for thinking through these issues.

4. **Build practical skills**: The resource offers practical guidance for historians who want to incorporate AI tools into their research workflow responsibly and effectively.

This addition aligns with the awesome-digital-history list's mission to help researchers "learn how to research history digitally" and complements other learning resources that focus on digital methods, computational thinking, and programming for historians.
